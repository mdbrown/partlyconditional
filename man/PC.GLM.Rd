\title{Fit a partly conditional GLM (logistic) model}
\usage{
PC.GLM(id, stime, status, measurement.time, predictors, data, prediction.time)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{name of numeric subject id in data}

\item{stime}{name of survival time, may be repeated across subj. id.}

\item{status}{name of survival status indicator, generally 1 = bad outcome/death, 0 alive/censored.}

\item{measurement.time}{name of time of measurement from baseline.}

\item{data}{data.frame with id, stime, status, measurement time  and marker variables. Observations with missing data will be removed.}

\item{prediction.time}{numeric value for the prediction time of interest to fit the PC logistic model.}

\item{markers}{character vector consisting of marker names to include.}
}
\value{
An object of class "PC_GLM" which is a list containing:

\item{model.fit }{ A 'glm' object . Please note that the estimates of standard error associated with the model coefficients DO NOT incorporate the variation due to marker smoothing using BLUPs. }
\item{variable.names }{vector of variable names used to fit the model. }
\item{call}{Function call. }
#'#' \item{ prediction.time}{Inputs from function call. }
}
\description{
Fit a partly conditional (PC) logistic model. PC models are helpful predictive tools for (medical) contexts where long-term follow-up is available and interest lies in predicting patientsâ€™ risks for a future adverse outcome using repeatedly measured predictors over time. These methods model the risk of an adverse event conditional on survival up to a landmark time and information accrued by that time.
}
\examples{
data(pc_data)
#'#log transform measurement time for use in models.
pc_data$log.meas.time <- log10(pc_data$meas.time + 1)

pc.glm.1 <-  PC.GLM(
 id = "sub.id",
 stime = "time",
 status = "status",
 measurement.time = "meas.time",
 predictors = c("log.meas.time", "marker_1", "marker_2"),
 prediction.time = 24,
 data = pc_data)

pc.glm.1

pc.glm.1$model.fit #direct access to the glm model object

#see function BLUP to fit mixed effects models and obtain BLUP-smoothed predictors.
