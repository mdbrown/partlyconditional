Description: This package provides functions to fit partly conditional (PC) risk models, which are a helpful class of predictive models often used in medical contexts where long-term follow-up is available and interest lies in predicting patients' risks for a future adverse outcome using repeatedly measured predictors over time. Please see the reference Zheng YZ, Heagerty PJ (2005) <doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00323.x>  or Maziarz M, et. al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12562> for further details.
